## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM methodology

### What I learned
I’ve learned how to manage scaling font sizes without using many media queries. For example:

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 3.5rem);
}
```
Using the clamp function and relative measures, i’ve made a responsive layout.


### Continued development

I already know how to make layouts for web pages using Grid, but i still think that i need to keep focusing even more on different and practical ways to implement it.
